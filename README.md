## Software Company
I created a full ontology of a Software Company with OWL,

- #### There are many individuals like people, languages, Servers.
- #### Properties with unique uses like Symmetric , Transitive , InverseOf, Functional.
- #### Enough classes to represent the Software Company with Restrictions (eg. Existential,HasValue,Universal) with the right hierarchy.

*I also used **Protege 5.5.0** for verification and  inserting data.*
