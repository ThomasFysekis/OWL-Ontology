# Software Company
This ontology represents a full ontology of a Software Company using OWL.

- The ontology includes individuals such as people, programming languages, and servers, as well as properties with unique uses such as Symmetric, Transitive, InverseOf, and Functional.

- The ontology also includes a wide range of classes to represent the Software Company, including restrictions such as Existential, HasValue, and Universal, with the appropriate hierarchy.

*To create and verify the ontology, I used **Protege 5.5.0**, which allowed for easy data insertion and verification.*
